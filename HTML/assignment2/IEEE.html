                        <p>Old Age Retirement Home Swarnavihar, an institution for assisted-care living that houses elderly people in need, is located close to Sinhagad Road. Its main goal is to take care of them and help them in any manner that they can. On August 15th, IEEE SB VIT Pune organised a social visit to Swarnavihar. The crew engaged with the residents and organised several events, including a Ramayana quiz, a jam session of classic Hindi songs, and an open mic where the seniors expressed their thoughts and feelings with everyone. Our team was ecstatic with the feedback we got from them, and we also discovered a lot from our discussions.</p>

                        <p>After receiving an overwhelmingly positive reaction, CodeZest'22 was successfully held on September 11th, 2022! Our speaker, Mr. Kunal Raut, provided his invaluable insights with such passion, and our attendees, a wonderful audience, learned the roadmap to Competitive Coding and Cracking Placements under his guidance. We are very grateful. The Coding Competition after that was a big success. The competitors raced to solve as many problems as they could while still experiencing new and great things for themselves as the clock ran down.</p>

                        <p>IEEE Mania was held in our college in observance of IEEE Day. The occasion was a great success.All thanks to the active participation of the students.On the campus of our college, a variety of activities were held, including Technical Heads-Up, Chess, Guess the Phrase, Pac-Robo, and more. Responses to the question'If not engineering then what?' revealed the untapped creative potential of VIT students.The technical treasure hunt in VIT really brought out the Sherlocks. It was awesome to watch all of these detectives compete on the campus. The event's participants appeared to appreciate the varied activities.</p>
